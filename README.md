## 📖 Overview

Welcome to the "Minimal Reconnection for Brain Resilience". This software helps model brain network fragmentation, such as what occurs in Alzheimer's disease. It introduces a method called ORT-THERAPY-F, which provides a simple yet effective way to reconnect brain networks. Unlike traditional methods, it achieves complete reconnection with a significant boost in efficiency.
